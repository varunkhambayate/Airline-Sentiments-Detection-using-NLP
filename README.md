# Airline-Sentiments-Detection-using-NLP
# <h3> Description </h3> In this Project given a dataset first I've performed some Data Visulualization to understand what the data is about, with the help of Seaborn Library in Python. It contains reviews of Flights of several customers along with their sentiments. By making use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) I've build a model that can predict the sentiments of several reviews. Sklearn library makes it very easy to make use of Count Vectoriser, TfidfTransformer, TfidfVectoriser. This is a Classification task and comes under Supervised Machine Learning.
